              <p>
                In 2000, Yolanda (Yo to her teammates) competed with DCAC at the USMS Long Course National Championships.
                The large crowd chanted “Go Mom, Go” as she swam her way to a fourth place finish in the 50 free in the
                women’s 80–84 age group. Yo died January 5, 2021 at the age of 101.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mid-1930s, Yo learned to swim at the Greensburg, Pennsylvania YMCA during the one afternoon a week
                that the facility opened its doors to women. She loved tennis, golf, and swimming, and saw to it that her
                four children became competitive swimmers. Whether carpooling to and from early morning practices, feeding
                dozens of hungry neighborhood swimmers, or roaming the pool deck as a timer, score keeper, or clerk of
                course, Yo was the quintessential swim mom.

              <p className="sch-tribute-role">Mother of DCAC swimmer and coach Steve Dickens</p>
              <p>
                Marcay was a DCAC member from 2002–2007 and a longtime USMS member. She passed away November 3, 2017 at
                the age of 83. Marcay swam at the very first USMS Long Course Nationals, held in 1972 in Bloomington,
                Indiana. She also competed for DCAC at several swim meets including IGLA 2003 San Francisco, IGLA 2004
                Ft. Lauderdale, and IGLA 2005 Atlanta, scoring boatloads of points for DCAC in the 50 free, 50 back,
                100 back, and 100 free.
              </p>
              <p>
                In San Francisco, she was part of the first Mixed 240+ Medley Relay that had ever been fielded by an IGLA
                team. She holds several DCAC 70–74 team records as well. She was an example of a strategy employed
                particularly well for a period of time whereby senior members were specifically recruited to compete for
                the team at IGLA (see: Jack Markey).

              <p className="sch-tribute-role">Mother of DCAC swimmer and long-time board member Fred Dever</p>
              <p>
                Joan had a passion for health and physical fitness throughout her life. She was an avid competitor in
                swimming, synchronized swimming, golf, and tennis. In the 1950s, Joan was a synchronized swimmer for the
                Elliott Murphy Aqua Show at Flushing Meadows Amphitheater.
              </p>
              <p>
                She was the first head swim coach of the Fayetteville-Manlius High School women’s swim team, and taught
                and coached several sports teams full-time throughout Long Island. Furthering her drive and dedication to
                sports and physical fitness, Joan earned a bachelor’s degree in Health and Physical Education from
                Brockport State University and a master’s degree from Syracuse University.
