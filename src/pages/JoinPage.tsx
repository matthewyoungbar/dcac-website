                  USMS is the national organizing body for all Masters swimmers in the United States. Registration with USMS is <strong>mandatory</strong> for every calendar year and serves as your liability insurance. It's required in order for you to practice with DCAC and to be eligible to compete in meets. Choose Potomac Valley as your LMSC and then DCAC as your club team. Included in your USMS membership is a calendar-year subscription to USMS's SWIMMER Magazine and The Swimmer's Ear newsletter published by our regional USMS Committee, Potomac Valley LMSC. USMS provides accident insurance to its members at team practices and at USMS-sanctioned events. <a href="#">Register online.</a>
